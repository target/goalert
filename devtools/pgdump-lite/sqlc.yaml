# We need to keep a separate sqlc.yaml file for pgdump-lite because
# it's used by make db-schema, which is used by the rest of GoAlert in
# the main sqlc.yaml file.
#
# If we combine them then we end up with a circular dependency that's
# difficult to resolve.
#
# Separating them means we can build/run pgdump-lite without make db-schema.
